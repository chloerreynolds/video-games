My pitch has changed a lot, I've settled on something I think stays true to my goal of using multimedia journalism in fun and creative ways to engage younger audiences. 

Now, I am playing in a dataset I found on Kaggle.com about video game sales. Video game reporting is a potential field I'd like to break into, and this will be a good clip that shows interest in dataviz and in entertainment tech. I am still figuring our R, which is a golliath task. i would find it helpful if we could be provided with some tutorials to look at on youtube or linkedin learning or the like, I'd like to learn more about R, and I still find it confusing.

In terms of project progress, I am working between R and google sheets to clean my data and restructure it in a way that will pave the way for clear, concise, viz. I had a meeting w you (obviously) yesterday and think I'd like to make a stream graphic of publisher/company growth as it's been illustrated by their sales revenue with each game release. Another chart I'd like to do is a stream graphic or line chart of popularity of genres of games, speficially looking at the rise of games that are more violent (fortnite, call of duty, and the like). This week I am working on getting more familiar with R and cleaning my data.
